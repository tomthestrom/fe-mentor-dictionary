### Links

- Solution URL - unfortunately here the screenshot taken by FE Mentor is not 100% matching the reality, so it's not quite possible to compare it with the design - as it lacks some styling that is present on the live site - better check and compare it with the live site...enough talk, the solution posted on FE mentor is here: [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/dictionary-web-app-react-XJjzcyUarm)
- Live Site URL: [Dictionary Web App - GH Pages](https://tomthestrom.github.io/fe-mentor-dictionary/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension language


### What I learned

This was my first time using React, having just completed the tutorial at [react.dev](https://react.dev/learn). I also brushed up on my (S)CSS skills, which I've not used for a while. :)
